Matplotlib VS Pandas:
This repository contains data analysis and visualization projects using pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for creating insightful plots. These projects demonstrate how to clean, 
analyze, and present data effectively using Python.

üìà Matplotlib is a widely used Python library for data visualization. It enables users to create static, animated, and interactive plots with a high level of customization.

Key Uses:
Creating line charts, bar graphs, histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, etc.
Customizing charts with labels, legends, colors, and styles
Exporting plots as images (PNG, PDF, SVG, etc.)

Advantages:
Highly customizable plots
Works seamlessly with pandas and NumPy
Supports complex visualizations and subplots
Open-source and well-documented

üêº pandas
pandas is a powerful Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides two main data structures: Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D), which make it easy to handle and analyze 
structured data.

Key Uses:
Reading data from CSV, Excel, SQL, and JSON files
Cleaning and transforming raw data
Filtering, sorting, and grouping datasets
Handling missing values and time-series data

Advantages:
Easy-to-use syntax for data wrangling
Highly optimized for performance
Integrates well with NumPy, Matplotlib, and other libraries

# üå´Ô∏è Air Quality Analysis: Delhi, January 2023

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes **air quality data for Delhi, India during January 2023**, with the aim of identifying pollution trends, patterns, and correlations between key pollutants.

Through data exploration and visualization, we uncover significant insights into Delhi‚Äôs environmental health, which can help guide public awareness, policymaking, and further research.

---

## üìä Key Findings

### üõë Predominantly Poor Air Quality
- Over **97%** of the time, Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) fell into the **"Very Poor"** or **"Severe"** categories.
- Indicates **severe pollution levels** that pose substantial **health risks** to residents.

### üåô Nighttime AQI Slightly Higher
- On average, **nighttime AQI was marginally higher** than daytime AQI.
- May suggest cooler temperatures trap pollutants closer to the surface overnight.

### üîó Strong Correlations Between Pollutants
- **High correlation** observed between pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, and NO2.
- Suggests **common emission sources** (e.g., traffic, industry, biomass burning) or similar **dispersion patterns**.

---

## üìÇ Dataset
- **Source**: air quality monitoring data  
- **Location**: Delhi, India  
- **Features**:
  - AQI (Air Quality Index)
  - PM2.5, PM10
  - NO2, CO, SO2, O3
  - Date and Time

---

## üîß Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Google Colab**

# Business Insights from Transaction Data

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a real-world transaction dataset to extract meaningful business insights related to customer spending patterns, merchant activity, and transaction timing.

The goal is to leverage **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and data visualization techniques to support strategic business decisions in finance and retail sectors.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains transaction logs with fields such as:
- Transaction ID
- Date & Time
- Client ID
- Card ID
- Transaction Amount
- Use of Chip Technology
- Merchant Details (City, Merchant Category Code - MCC)

---

## Analysis Highlights

- Identified top merchant categories and cities generating the most transactions.
- Analyzed transaction frequency by hour, day, and month to understand temporal trends.
- Explored transaction amount distributions to spot typical ranges and potential outliers.
- Examined the prevalence of chip-enabled card usage among transactions.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation

---

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Place the dataset (`transactions_dataset.csv`) in the appropriate directory.
3. Open `ShadowFox_Business_Insights.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
4. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

---

## Insights & Recommendations
- Focus marketing and promotions on top merchant categories to maximize ROI.
- Allocate merchant support resources during peak transaction hours.
- Monitor transaction amounts for anomaly detection and fraud prevention.
- Encourage wider adoption of chip card technology for enhanced security.
