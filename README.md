Matplotlib VS Pandas:
This repository contains data analysis and visualization projects using pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for creating insightful plots. These projects demonstrate how to clean, 
analyze, and present data effectively using Python.

üìà Matplotlib is a widely used Python library for data visualization. It enables users to create static, animated, and interactive plots with a high level of customization.

Key Uses:
Creating line charts, bar graphs, histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, etc.
Customizing charts with labels, legends, colors, and styles
Exporting plots as images (PNG, PDF, SVG, etc.)

Advantages:
Highly customizable plots
Works seamlessly with pandas and NumPy
Supports complex visualizations and subplots
Open-source and well-documented

üêº pandas
pandas is a powerful Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides two main data structures: Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D), which make it easy to handle and analyze 
structured data.

Key Uses:
Reading data from CSV, Excel, SQL, and JSON files
Cleaning and transforming raw data
Filtering, sorting, and grouping datasets
Handling missing values and time-series data

Advantages:
Easy-to-use syntax for data wrangling
Highly optimized for performance
Integrates well with NumPy, Matplotlib, and other libraries

Air Quality Analysis: Delhi, January 2023
This project analyzes air quality data for Delhi, India in January 2023. Key findings include:

Predominantly Poor Air Quality:
Over 97% of the time, Delhi's air quality fell into the "Very Poor" or "Severe" categories.
This highlights concerning pollution levels with potential health risks.
Nighttime AQI Slightly Higher: On average, nighttime AQI was marginally higher than daytime AQI.
Strong Correlations Between Pollutants: The analysis revealed strong correlations between various pollutants, suggesting shared sources or dispersion patterns.

This project provides valuable insights into Delhi's air quality and can be a template for analyzing environmental data from other cities or pollutants.
